# LCZoomTransition

A custom UIViewController animated and interactive transition for use in master detail apps that uses a zoom in effect when going from master to detail and a zoom out effect when going back to the master view.

When returning to the master view the 'back' transition can be interactively controlled by either a pinch gesture or the standard iOS 7 screen edge pan 'back' gesture.

As used in my app [ThenDo](http://thendo.it)

## Requirements

* iOS 7.0 or later.
* ARC memory management.

## Usage

The easiest way to install it is by copying the following to your project:

* LCZoomTransition.h
* LCZoomTransition.m

* In your master view controller, initialize an instance of an LCZoomTransition, passing it your navigation controller:

        self.zoomTransition = [[LCZoomTransition alloc] initWithNavigationController:self.navigationController];

* Add a property to your detail view controller to be able to make the transition a gesture target:

        @property (nonatomic, strong) id<LCZoomTransitionGestureTarget> gestureTarget;

* In `prepareForSegue` in your master view controller tell the transition which cell (view) originated the transition and, optionally, set the gesture target on the detail view controller (if you want to uyse the interactive 'back' gestures):

````Objective-C
    // the transition controller needs to know the view (cell)
    // that originated the segue in order to be able to "split"
    // the table view correctly
    self.zoomTransition.sourceView = [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];

    // pass the custom transition to the destination controller
    // so it can use it when setting up its gesture recognizers
    [[segue destinationViewController] setGestureTarget:self.zoomTransition];
````

* If you want the interactive 'back' gestures, in `viewDidLoad` in your detail view controller setup the gesture recognizers:

````Objective-C
    // setup a pinch gesture recognizer and make the target the custom transition handler
    UIPinchGestureRecognizer *pinchRecognizer = [[UIPinchGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self.gestureTarget action:@selector(handlePinch:)];
    [self.view addGestureRecognizer:pinchRecognizer];
    
    // setup an edge pan gesture recognizer and make the target the custom transition handler
    UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer *edgePanRecognizer = [[UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self.gestureTarget action:@selector(handleEdgePan:)];
    edgePanRecognizer.edges = UIRectEdgeLeft;
    [self.view addGestureRecognizer:edgePanRecognizer];
````

* That's it! See the included example project to see it in action.
